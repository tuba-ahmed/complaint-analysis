       "I provided a letter to Equifax that contained an AUD number for the deletion of a collection account entered by XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$240.00}. This should have resulted in an immediate removal following verification of authenticity. Furthermore, I gave the AUD number to the representative, XXXX, that I spoke with on XXXX/XXXX/2016. I understand that most cases would require a XXXX investigation but the credit bureau has been given the tracking number for the deletion which should expedite this matter and they have chosen to ignore it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",

       "In XX/XX/2019, I initiated a transfer via Alliant Credit Union's website, to transfer $XXXX from my XXXX XXXX checking account into my Alliant Account. The app told me that it would be available on XX/XX/XXXX. In the past, each transfer I have made in this manner has cleared on the date that the app said it would be available. I logged into my account on XX/XX/XXXX and noticed the money had not transferred. Further, I logged into my XXXX XXXX account and them money had never left XXXX XXXX. I went into my transfer history and pending transfer list on the Alliant app, but no transfers showed. It appeared that the transfer was somehow deleted. So, I initiated the transfer again. Sure enough, the next day a transfer appeared, and a second one occurred thereafter. This second transfer caused the XXXX   XXXX account to become overdrawn. The second transfer was returned, and XXXX XXXX charged me a $XXXX  fee and Alliant   charged me a $XXXX  fee. All of this was because of the glitch on Alliant's end where the deposit did not clear when it was promised, but more importantly, did not even show as a pending or historic transfer. There was no evidence on the app that the transfer existed at all. I called Alliant on XX/XX/XXXX and requested these fees be refunded. I further told them that they should let their IT team know about the issue on their app with pending transfers not showing up. I was told a supervisor would contact me to discuss the issue. I was never contacted and the fees were not refunded.       1\n",
