## Abstract:

Customer satisfaction plays a crucial role in any business. In fact, it is shown that a company that has a high level of customer satisfaction yields a higher retention rate of customers, as well as having a positive brand reputation, and overall having a greater lifetime value. Customer satisfaction also plays an important role in driving customer loyalty and boosts their acquisition, as well as reflecting on the business team’s performance. With the digitization of most businesses, managing customer satisfaction in the digital space has become exceedingly important. While some industries have a rigorous focus on customer outcomes through government regularization, other businesses will benefit from introducing this aspect of process improvement into their workflow.

In this project, we aim to propose an analysis of consumer complaints based on text mining and natural language processing techniques to produce insights into consumer behavior and actionable steps businesses can take to improve customer satisfaction and retention. This is technically known as proactive complaint management analysis. Specifically, the problem we will be addressing is that of the classification of a particular customer complaint appropriately so that it can be routed to the right place for redressal. This will be particularly useful in scenarios where the incoming complaint volume is significant.

Our approach to this solution is two-fold. First, we aim to use standard sentiment analysis techniques to classify the complaints into standard categories. Second, we plan to apply topic modeling using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to classify the given complaints and identify potential new categories.

For this analysis, we plan to use the ‘Consumer Complaint Database' dataset provided by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). This is a standard dataset where each entry is validated such that there is an established commercial relationship between the business entity and the consumer.
