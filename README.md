## ABSTRACT:

The primary goal of this project is to automate categorization of consumer complaints using text mining analysis and natural language processing techniques. We also intend to produce insights into consumer behavior and suggest actionable steps businesses can take to improve customer satisfaction and retention. This is technically known as proactive complaint management analysis. Specifically, the problem we will be addressing is that of the classification of a particular customer complaint appropriately so that it can be routed to the right place for redressal. This will be particularly useful in scenarios where the incoming complaint volume is significant.
